        <p>
            Hey! I'm an engineering student and software engineer with the spirit of a curious toddler still burning within, 
            ready to mess around and find out things.

            Currently pursuing my masters in Robotics with specialization in Algorithms, Software and AI from the University of Twente.

        Tinkering through life.
    </h3>

        <p>
            My journey of playing with the notion of "what if I do this..?" with things started pretty early from what I heard from my parents. 
            One of my favourite toys had broken when I was a kid, it was a RC car. This led me to dig into it with a spare screwdriver and see and 
            learn how it worked with assistance from my dad. This helped me learn what a motor does, what a battery is and that it operated on DC current which also 
            led me to be curious about the link between this DC current and a cassete tape of AC/DC's album my dad had which then got me into music 
            thereby leading to a chain reaction of events that made me the "me" I am today.
