            History of me.
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering and continued to work in Software Development writing code for 
            real time distributed backend services and linux system utilities for 3 years before embarking on my aurrent journey to pursue MSc 
            in Robotics from University of Twente in Enschede, Netherlands.

            Tinkering through life.
        </h3>

            <p>
                My journey of playing with the notion of "what if I do this..?" with things started pretty early from what I heard from my parents. 
                One of my favourite toys had broken when I was a kid, it was a RC car. This led me to dig into it with a spare screwdriver and see and 
                learn how it worked with assistance from my dad. This helped me learn what a motor does, what a battery is and that it operated on DC current which also 
                led me to be curious about the link between this DC current and a cassete tape of AC/DC's album my dad had which then got me into music 
                thereby leading to a chain reaction of events that made me the "me" I am today.

            <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a>Tinkering space.</h4>

            <p>
                When we talk about tinkering space, my current space is a serious work in progress as I just moved to a new country and still setting up shop. 
                That being said, I do have a very memorable tinkering space that helped me discover my love for this craft. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This was when I was in college 
                for my bachelors and joined a student team as a robotics developer and they had a space that was my go-to mess-around space. 
                <br>
                Here is a glimpse of that space :
            </p>
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="./assets/tinker_space.JPG" title="A weird picture of my workspace I took few years back." width="300px">
            </div>

            <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a> Tinkering domain : Electronics and Software.</h4>

            <p>
                My primary tinkering domain is easily electronics interestingly because growing up in the post Y2K era, there was a ton 
                of electronic waste to play around with as a kid. Everything from LEDs to filament bulbs to lasers salvaged from DVD players to
                microwave oven transformers that can take someones heartbeat away in a heartbeat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once my prefrontal cortex started developing as a teen, I got into the field of controlling these electronics with code. 
                This made me dive into the world of software and I ended up really really loving it as a perfect bridge between the abstract logic of code
                and physical hardware. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a> Spending time off-screen : Reclamation of leisure and attention resistance.</h4>

            <p>
                In the modern world that weaponizes attention span to synthetically engrain a new product we don't want into our minds,
                it is a saddening thought to realize that forming a reasonable unbiased thought is becoming rarer and rarer.
            </p>
            <p>
                To resist this blitzkreig of digital blackholes sucking me into it, I resort to choosing a life that we forgot about, a low tech life.
                Ofcourse doing this in absolution is impossible since most things you need to function run on the digital realm. 
                So I started going out on walks when I fully disconnect for a couple hours a day where I walk somewhere and either read a book 
                or just observe the surroundings and channel my thoughts. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a> Wishlist for expanding my space.</h4>
            <p>
                One thing I value a lot about the art of tinkering is the fact that it allows one to be independent of the wave of consumerism that 
                rose in the last few decades and just fix something that broke instead of getting a new thing to replace it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this one of the easiest and the most impactful thing a tinkerer can have is a good 3D printer and thus this would easily be 
                one of the things I would like to add to my personal arseanal of tools. Ofcourse this also must be easily repairable and DIY friendly. 
            </p>
