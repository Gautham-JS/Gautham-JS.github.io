            Session 1 : Getting Started.
        </h3>

            <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a>Introduction.</h4>
            <p>
                In this session the first requirement was creating ones own portfolio website, that is this very webpage we have before our eyes :D
                Next, we dive into the design process of tinkering tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this I decided to start off with an initial baby step of prototyping one of the biggest hurdles in software in my opinion, 
                having a humane vision of abstraction. For this I had a vision to build a set of jigsaw and lego inspired card set that can 
                be interfaced to visually represent algorithms and how various sub-components piece together to create a larger component. 
                We will refer to this hypothetical tool as <i>"Algocards"</i>
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a>Design Prototyping Algocards.</h4>
            For this design, I initially consided the design of the cards itself as drawings, an initial drawing-board of ideas on how the cards can 
            represent the most common paradigm of software components, an input and output method. For this, 2 appraoches were considered:
            <ol>
                <li> <b> Jigsaw blocks: </b>
                    <p>
                        I thought a jigsaw inspired card would be a 
                        good starting point as the concave notches can be an input to whatever a card represents and a convex notch can be the output.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li> <b> Thread connected blocks: </b>
                    <p>
                        Another contender for this would be the use of threads where the information flows from left to right when the cards are laid
                        out on the table. Similar to how most people comprehend written language.
                    </p>
                </li>

            <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a>Reflection Questions.</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Tinkering is widely associated with trial-and-error and brainstorming.  
                    Find dictionary definitions of the three techniques, and compare them. 
                    Does the definition of tinkering match the definition we have in the course? 
                    Also, ask a generative AI tool for the definitions and differences. Which aspects does the answer provided miss?</b>
                    
                    <p>
                        According to Cambridge Dictionary, The definitions of the three techniques are:
                        <ul>
                            <li> <i>Tinkering : </i>
                                To make small changes to something, especially in an attempt to repair or improve it
                            </li>
                            <li><i>Train and Error : </i>
                                A way of achieving an aim or solving a problem by trying a number of different methods and learning from the mistakes that you make
                            </li>
                            <li><i>Brainstorming : </i>
                                An activity or business method in which a group of people meet to suggest a lot of new ideas for possible development
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>


                        Asking the same definitions to a generative AI, Claude AI in this case yields these:
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <i>Tinkering : </i>
                                Tinkering is a hands-on approach where you explore, experiment, and modify something to understand how it works or to improve it.
                            </li>
                            <li><i>Train and Error : </i>
                                Trial-and-error is a problem-solving method where multiple attempts are made until a solution is found.
                            </li>
                            <li><i>Brainstorming : </i>
                                Brainstorming is a creative thinking technique focused on generating multiple ideas before evaluating them.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        Both of these definitions of tinkering misses one thing in my opinion from what was discussed in lecture that, 
                        tinkering is a process that continually involves the other processes (trial-and-error and brainstorming) as subsets of it
                        and tinkering does not have a end per-se. 
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Can you take a typical I-Tech related project case, list and explain 5 technical hurdles? 
                    To which extent do they allow for a 'tinkering' approach in tackling them? Please give arguments.</b>
                    <p>
                        As part of this, I will be taking inspiration from the field of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. This was done as part of the course 
                        "Virtual Reality" offered as part of Industrial Design Engineering in UT but I also think based on my experience, the subjects fits the Interaction 
                        Technology category too. 
                        <br>
                        The projet case was designing a VR solution to aid people in some way on a new building being built in the UT campus. For this we decided to build
                        a VR/AR solution that allows people unfamiliar with the space to interact and learn about the space within their comfort zones. These were some of
                        The most prominent technical hurdles faced in our process:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>User Interface & UX : </i> Designing a solution that is also easy to use in an abstract space as VR is naturally hard for the 
                                human brain to comprehend and we faced problems that made the system have a learning curve. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Feasibility : </i> The solution was particularly hard to optimize and run on a platform such as a smartphone. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <i>Accessibility : </i> The solution was also very hard to make accessible to disabled people as interaction often relies on a human sense and it.  
                            </li>
                        </ul> 
                    </p>
