                <ol>
                    <li><b>Tinkering is a way to generate knowledge. What kind of knowledge results from a tinkering process in your experience?</b>
                    <p>
                        In my experience, Tinkering generates knowledge by means of self guided creative innovation. One is free to play around with any aspect of an environment
                        and see how it responds. In this process we usually try a bunch of things to get a 'thing' to do what we want it to do, in this process we explore
                        a plethora of possibilities. Even though not all possibilities are valid for this specific use-case, it usually helps build knowledge around the tinkering space.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Tinkering with classical materials like clay, paper, colour, textiles is more related to craft. How does tinkering work with digital and electronic media?</b>
                    <p>
                        In a practical sense, tinkering with digital media offers the same "tinkerable" approach to the materials available to achieve something as classical materials.
                        Just as assembling something with clay, paper and colour to create craft, tinkering can be used with digital and electronic media to create other digital creations
                        or electronic assemblies all the while using the same methodology. This involves the methodology we encountered earlier as 'affordance', 'self guiding nature',
                        'interoperability' and other properties that defines "tinkerability" as I mentioned in the start of this answer.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>One basic characteristic of science is reproducibility. Is that possible with tinkering? Or do we want that at all?</b>
                    <p>
                        Reproducibility of science is a crucial element especially in the realm of research. Although it is an important characteristic of
                        science, it may be optional in tinkering in my understanding as tinkering may lead to a "un-reproducible" outcome. This un-tracable outcome
                        observed while tinkering can act as a foundation for scientific research by tracing back and figuring out the outcome and making it reproducible.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Design practice changed during the past years, from long design phases to short, iterative processes, due to the availability of new prototyping technologies. Is this iterative process of prototyping qualitatively different from the cycles we do in tinkering?</b>
                    <p>
                        The iterative cycles we do in tinkering is close to what we do in iterative design but iteration in tinkering is more focused on getting new insights by
                        trying new things. This therefore enables exploring the search space made affordable by an environment. In design the goal is to iterate on 
                        an existing plan or idea and not deviate too much from that idea.
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Can a co-design session be described as a tinkering session as we treat it in our course?</b>
                    <p>
                        A co-design session cannot be considered tinkering as we discussed in this course as tinkering is about exploration using the materials
                        and the quest for serendipity. This makes it differ from co-design.
                    </p>
                    <li><b>The choice of materials (seed, tools, scaffolding, facilitation) has an effect on the outcome, the knowledge and products made in a tinkering session. How can we use that in a co-design session? Can we really influence the kind of results here, and do we want that?</b>
                    <p>
                        The core concepts of tinkering such as seed, tools, scafolding and facilitation can indeed be used in a co-design session by
                        modeling it with the approach of tinkering. This can be used to influence the outcome by allowing one to 
                        often come up with new surprising outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <li><b>In “research through design” can tinkering fill in the design part?</b>
                    <p>
                        In "research through design", we can indeed use tinkering to fill in the design part but then we would be opening ourselves up to
                        a wide range of possibilities by means of exploration. This may not be ideal for all types of design work but for research it can be quite useful.
                        In addition, a tinkering workshop can be a great place for such a design research.
                    </p>
                    <li><b>Are there design questions where tinkering is not a possible or useful approach?</b>
                    <p>
                        There certainly are design questions where tinkering is not a possible or useful approach. Few examples of this could be 
                        scoped design problems where constraints on scope of a solution prevents free exploration. Another example could be designing something with
                        standards and confidentiality regulations.  
                    </p>
                    <li><b>Read Invent to Learn3 page 41. how to balance real-world (criticality) with the fruitful mindset of tinkering?</b>
                    <p>
                        
                    </p>
                    <li><b>What is the critical impact your tinkering exercise could have? (on you, your design/engineering practice or problem, both positive and negative)</b>
                    <p>
                        Our tinkering exercise could have a critical impact in field of research, by using the tinkering observations as a means to create a 
                        testbed. Be it animatronics or sound generation platform, the explorations will certainly lead to new findings and not all of which can be feasible to
                        explore further. This can be an ideal spot for research to kick in.
                    </p>
                    <li><b>What is the impact your session have regarding (more) stuff, ecological footprint and impact on our planet (i.e. how can you avoid that STEM workshops with waste material result in more waste material?)</b>
                    <p>
                        Generally, tinkering sessions and making naturally brings about a sizable ecological footprint, it can be from scrap waste generated or shards of
                        microplastics released with 3D printed parts. Mitigating this is also hard as it usually means either compromising on the materials which is crucial for
                        tinkerability. A good compromise here would be a prioritization on using waste scraps as material, relying on recycled paper, minimizing the use 
                        of plastics as their recycling also involves a significant impact on the environment. 
                    </p>

                    The initial prototyping sketch simply included the drawing of the units generating the audio plugging into an output module.

                <p>
                The initial prototyping started off when we met as a team to firstly decide a scope. This was decided as a solution that allows 
                users to create music. Once this baseline was set, we started brainstorming on can it be built by keeping the philosophy of 
                tinkering in mind. This led us to the very first prototype sketch:

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="../assets/proto_sketch.png">

                        <a><i>Fig : The sketch of the music production cards.</i></a>
                    </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this prototyping was complete, we moved onto assmbling this on the breadboard as you can see in figure below titled "Amplifier module assembled in a breadboard circuit."
                </p>
            </div>



            <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a>Implementation.</h4>
            <div class="removed-section">
                <h3><i>Resit : Removed Section</i></h3>
                <p>
                    The cards were implemented as breadboard implementations of various audio components such as amplifier blocks that accept an audio signal and processes it by applying an 
                    amplification process to it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="new-section">
                <h3><i>Resit : Newly Added Section</i></h3>
                <p>
                    The cards were implemented as breadboard implementations of various audio components such as amplifier blocks that accept an audio signal and processes it by applying an 
                    amplification process to it. These processes can be combined and connected in combination with other units for processing and/or generation of music. 
                    The units capable of generating music can be regarded as the input module whereas the amplifier can be regarded as a processing
                    unit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The assembly of the amplifier followed a standard simple class B amplifier circuit in a breadboard. This circuit was designed in a way
                    that it can accept an incoming signal and perform the processing. This processing can be combined in a chained manner and users can play
                    around with the processing pipeline.
                </p>
            </div>
            

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../assets/amp.png">

                <a><i>Fig : Amplifier module assembled in a breadboard circuit.</i></a>

            <div class="new-section">
                <p>
                    At this point we knew that we were building a modular blocks of audio generation which can work with audio modification modules 
                    like the amplifier shown above. The next logical step is to come up with a methodology to allow "generation" of music. 
                    This was tackled using an inspiration that we got while exploring the music production software "Ableton", where we got the idea
                    of a tone generation module, that generates not one but many tones. These can be user defined as audio files inserted into the generation module
                    or a set of pre-recorded tones provided as a starter for newcomers. This helped shape our music generation and selector module
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We developed a music generator and selector module using a standard MP3 player module that contains samples of various tones of a piano. 
                Along with that we used a OLED display that can showcase the current tone that is playing and lets the user select and pick the tone they want and add that to the output
                effectively creating a tone picking circuit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The fidelity and interactability of this has been further improved by use of a RGB sensor that can be used to sense a color coded block that can represent an 
                instrument which can be used for tone picking.
            </p>
