            <p>
                This session goes further into the concept of facilitation in a setting such as a workshop or knowledge transfer event such as a classroom. 
                Also delves into various elements involved in sharing knowledge in context of tinkering.

                <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a>Session Overview.</h4>
                <p>
                    The concept of facilitation was explored further by going over processes such as scaffolding, material selection and interfacing. 
                    These concepts act as a building block for creating mediums and/or frameworks for promoting tinkerability, an example of such a framework 
                    introduced in this session is the LEGO
                    Serious Play Open Source framework.   
                </p>

            <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a>Reflection Questions.</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Take a look at the LEGO serious play method. Do adults need a different approach or role in facilitation? Which concepts are relevant?</b>
                    <p>
                        Adults do need a different approach to facilitation especially in Lego Serious play as it is intended for adults with expertise in a certain domain to use
                        Lego Open Source document as a starting point and tinker on top of it. In this the concepts I found are "connection among participants", "exploration", 
                        "reflection on what has been achieved", "Connect new knowledge to new challenges".
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Read Invent to Learn chapter 5. Where do Papert and Montessori meet up? 
                    is there a fundamental difference in their approach? 
                    How well do their mantra's and thoughts on teaching translate to tinkering for 'children of different ages'?</b>
                    <p>
                        Both Papert and Montessori meet on the fact that learning in classrooms should be centered around engagement with materials, working on personally meaningful projects,
                        use of clever prepared environments. This mantra translates to children of any age group as these learning methodologies are a human thing that is almost independent of age.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Read Invent To Learn chapter 9. What are useful pointers for the space (location) and setting? Do you need a designlab/fablab?</b>
                    <p>
                        Here it is argued that for most makerspaces, the functionality and accessibility matter most. Along with this it is also important for tools to be visible and 
                        accessible and the space should target promoting collaboration. A designlab acts as a perfect meeting spot of all this as a makerspace and thus I strongly agree 
                        existence of designlabs and fablabs are very important.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Now get back to your own practice as a designer/engineer:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Where in a process do you use tinkering?</b>
                            <p>
                                In a process tinkering is most prominent in the design phase of the solution as well as the ideation phase before actual design.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>How can you translate a design problem or research problem into a tinkering playground?</b>
                            <p>
                                By allowing creative freedom and exploring possible options.

                        <li><b>What can you use to get unstuck? </b>
                            <p>
                                Collaboration is one of the biggest methods one can use to get unstuck by sharing ideas and solutions. In addition to that as the famous saying in software goes, 
                                there is no better debugger than a good nights sleep, Good rest and taking time with a solution is also crucial to get unstuck.

                        </li>
                        <li><b>how do you get in the flow?</b>
                            <p>
                                I get in the flow by reading up about recent developments in my realm of expertise and surprisingly challenging myself a little every time. 
                            </p>
                        </li>

            <hr>
            <div class="new-section">
                <h3><i>Resit : Newly Added Section</i></h3>
                <h4 class="subsection-hdr"> <a class="ss-marker">--</a>Design Exercise.</h4>
                <p>
                    The design exercise focuses on coming up with a concept where we can use the concept of scaffolding with material selection and 
                    interfacing between them as discussed in the session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this, I decided to get inspired by the plethora of low-code programming platforms available that convert programming into a set of
                    modular blocks that can be interconnected. This is also mixed with the interface provided by node based software like Blender/Unity/Unreal Engine/TouchDesigner
                    where each node performs a function with input and output parameters. Output of one function is connected to the input to another to create a pipeline.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach can be turned into something physical, such as the cardboard building design of MakeDo. This can be a set of cardboard blocks
                    that each perform a certain function, such as "addition" or "multiplication". They can be connected using threads to connect inputs and outputs.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such a design already allows creation of programming paradigms such as data-flow between functions which can be very beneficial for 
                    beginners in programming. But now the next big problem becomes actually "running" it, how can we perform logic operations with something 
                    physical such as cardboard?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This problem can be overcome using an overhead camera, a tool designed to bridge the gap between physical and tangible world to the abstract 
                    space of software.
